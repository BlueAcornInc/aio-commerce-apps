# Yotpo Installation Guide

Reviews and other concerns are presented to customers through blocks in Adobe Commerce Storefront. Some configurations can be stored in the content repo, or in the Adobe Commerce Administrative backoffice where things like private credentials can be stored. The blocks are designed to be paired with the app to provide complete functionality.

## Installing the App

Installing the app can be done by copying the blocks from the block collection into your Adobe Commerce Storefront.

# Install Store Locator to your Commerce Storefront

* [Store Locator Block Collection](https://github.com/blueacorninc/aio-commerce-storelocator-blocks)
* [Reference Store Locator Block in da.live](https://da.live/edit#/blueacorninc/shop/store-locator)

Installation is easy, simply copy in the `storelocator` blocks from our block collection, and reference them in the doc in question.

## Document-based Authoring

To add the store locator block, simply create a table within the document you want to embed it, with the header named `store-locator` like so. This will reference the block copied in with the previous step.
